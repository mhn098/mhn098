# Hello, I'm Michelle! Welcome to my github page! 😄

## About Me
I'm a senior at UNC-Chapel Hill majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science and Information Systems. At UNC, I've worn many hats: Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, and Club President. These roles have taught me how to lead, collaborate with diverse teams, and support a growing community of over 400 active members and 2,500+ Discord members.

I’ve worked across the full stack, but I’m especially drawn to frontend developement and user experience design. I find it incredibly rewarding to figure out what makes an interface click. What visual and interactive elements keep users coming back, or make complex workflows feel simple. There’s something so so satisfying about turning abstract ideas into designs that feel natural to use. It's where empathy meets engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring scenic routes, baking anything and everything, and playing video games! 🍃🍰🖥️
